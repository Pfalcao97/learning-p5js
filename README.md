## First project (10/08/23) - Aerial View over the country

Started with a grid, then added a square to the grid. Pushed that concept by adding recursive squares and then, later, shifting their positing by a random value. Started playing with a monocromatic color theme (it was blue, at first). Tried adding noise, to stylize the picture, but put the increment to the variable outside the loop (ðŸ¤¡), that made my pc overload and so, before figuring it out, increased the "noise square" size. After figuring it out, the noise square was big, and it ressembled clouds. I thought it looked like the ocean, it was nice, but green tones, like the country, would look nicer, and so it was done!
