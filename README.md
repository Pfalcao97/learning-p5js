## First project (10/08/23) - Aerial View over the country

Started with a grid, then added a square to the grid. Pushed that concept by adding recursive squares and then, later, shifting their positing by a random value. Started playing with a monocromatic color theme (it was blue, at first). Tried adding noise, to stylize the picture, but put the increment to the variable outside the loop (ðŸ¤¡), that made my pc overload and so, before figuring it out, increased the "noise square" size. After figuring it out, the noise square was big, and it ressembled clouds. I thought it looked like the ocean, it was nice, but green tones, like the country, would look nicer, and so it was done!

## Second project (13/08/23) - Trigonometry

Started trying out different things with trigonometry concepts. Eventually got an animation showing the sine working perfectly. Obviously, I pressed a wrong button and lost it all. From there I decided to just make a static image, but with more information stuff. It was a great learning ground and it actually was helpfull in teaching a bunch of concepts, specially dashed lines, using the `drawingContext` library, and text placement and styling. I also tried structuring the code in a bit more modular maner, which I thought made the code quite clean and readeble.
